# Kernel Auditor Profiles

#### Device: Google Pixel 3 | [Data Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHFUxYA4rxqh7wBzP85_khDCAXscVzbDDTGIlyFgN2k/edit?usp=sharing)

These profiles are meant to be imported using the [Kernel Auditor app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grarak.kerneladiutor).  However, this repository was created so that the various profiles / settings can be manually applied to any ROM or kernel.  

#### Data Driven Performance

Testing data of each profile will be contained in a publicly available spreadsheet on Google Drive for each device.  My testing standards typically consist of trials of ~30 hours (about two "days" of uptime, e.g. not charging, while your sleeping, etc...) of "regular use."  

**Balance** and **Battery** profiles are intended to be "daily drivers", where the former scores high benchmark points per rate of active drain (benchmark / %drain-per-hour) and the later is intended to provide optimal battery life with a largely "nerfed", though functioning system (e.g. more functional than the native "Battery Saver").

**Performance** and **Gaming** profiles are intended for situational use only (e.g. hotplugging).  That is, for application when you know you're going to be doing heavy multitasking or a lot of down/uploading (performance), or binging on your favorite game for the next 30 minutes (gaming).
